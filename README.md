# OpenGl
All of my Visual Studio 2017 OpenGL projects<br>
This was made to help me learn the basics of OpenGL as i've always had a passion for developing cool computer graphics <br>
This repository also contains a couple of helpful header files used to streamline the process of shader and game creation
